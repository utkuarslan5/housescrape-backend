The file `db.sqlite3` is not a file that contains code, but rather it is a database file generated by Django when using SQLite as the database backend. It is a binary file that is created and managed by the SQLite database engine, and it contains the actual data for your Django application.

Since you've mentioned using PostgreSQL for the database in your tech stack, the `db.sqlite3` file would not be applicable. Instead, you would configure your Django application to use PostgreSQL by setting the `DATABASES` configuration in your `app/settings.py` file.

However, if you still want to generate a `db.sqlite3` file for some reason, you would typically do so by running Django management commands which are not part of the codebase but are actions performed in the terminal. Here's how you would typically create the `db.sqlite3` file:

1. Make sure Django is configured to use SQLite as the database in `app/settings.py` (which is the default setting when you start a new Django project).
2. Run the following Django management command in your terminal to create the `db.sqlite3` file and apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command initializes the database specified in your settings and creates the necessary database tables according to the models defined in your `app/models.py` file. The `db.sqlite3` file is then automatically generated in the root directory of your Django project.

Since the actual content of `db.sqlite3` is binary and managed by SQLite, it is not something that can be generated as code here.
