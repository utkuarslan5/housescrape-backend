It seems there is a discrepancy in the provided information. The initial statement mentions a Django app, but the tech stack includes the Flask framework, which is a different Python web framework. For the purpose of this response, I will assume that we are building a Django application, as that is the first framework mentioned.

7. `TEMPLATES` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to configure template engines.
8. `WSGI_APPLICATION` - Exported in `app/settings.py` and referenced in `app/wsgi.py` for WSGI compatibility.
9. `ASGI_APPLICATION` - Exported in `app/settings.py` and referenced in `app/asgi.py` for ASGI compatibility.
10. `DATABASES` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to configure database connections, specifically PostgreSQL.
11. `STATIC_URL` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to define the URL to use for serving static files.
12. `STATICFILES_DIRS` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to define the filesystem paths to check when loading static files.
13. `MEDIA_URL` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to define the URL to use for serving media files.
14. `MEDIA_ROOT` - Exported in `app/settings.py` to define the filesystem path for media files.
15. `urlpatterns` - Defined in `app/urls.py` to map URLs to views.
16. `Model` classes - Defined in `app/models.py` and represent the data schema for the database.
17. `View` functions/classes - Defined in `app/views.py` to handle requests and return responses.
18. `Form` classes - Defined in `app/forms.py` to handle form rendering and validation.
19. `Admin` registration - Defined in `app/admin.py` to register models with the Django admin interface.
20. `AppConfig` - Defined in `app/apps.py` to configure the application.
21. `base.html` - DOM elements like `id` and `class` names used in `templates/base.html` and referenced in `static/js/script.js`.
22. `index.html` - DOM elements like `id` and `class` names used in `templates/index.html` and referenced in `static/js/script.js`.
23. `style.css` - CSS classes and ids defined in `static/css/style.css` and used in `templates/*.html`.

25. `.env` - Environment variables that might be shared across `app/settings.py` and other configuration files.
26. `Procfile` - Contains commands for running the application, typically referencing `app/wsgi.py` for web deployments.

Please note that the actual names of models, views, forms, JavaScript functions, and DOM element IDs would be determined by the specific implementation details of the application, which are not provided here.
